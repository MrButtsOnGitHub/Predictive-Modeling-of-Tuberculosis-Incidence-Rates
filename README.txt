##Tuberculosis Incidence Rate Prediction##

A machine learning project using PyTorch to predict Tuberculosis (TB) incidence rates based on socio-economic and regional data.

##Overview##

- Built a regression model to predict TB_Incidence_Rate.

- Preprocessed data with one-hot encoding and MinMax scaling.

- Designed a deep neural network with Dropout to prevent overfitting.

- Evaluated model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.

- Visualized training loss and prediction accuracy.
